?  You have an .exe file (probably from a C/C++ or similar program).
?  There are two functions inside:
* One prints hello world (this is the one currently running).
* One contains the flag (but it’s not called).
Use a disassembler or decompiler like:
* Ghidra 
* IDA Free 
Steps to solve
 a) Identify both functions
* Load the .exe into Ghidra or IDA.
* Find the main function and check which functions it calls.
* Locate the flag function (you might recognize it by name or by spotting strings like flag{...} inside).
 b) Check why the flag function isn’t called
* In main, you likely see a direct call to hello_world().
* There’s no call to the flag function — maybe it’s just unused.
 c) Patch the binary (optional)
* You can patch the binary:
o Replace the call to hello_world() with the call to flag_function().
o Save the patched binary and run it to print the flag.
 d) Or just extract the flag
* If the flag string is hardcoded (inside the binary), you can:
o Search for the string using strings or inside Ghidra’s string listing.
o Or decompile the flag function and see if it returns or prints the flag.
